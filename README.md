Some persons, especially elderly persons that are visually challenged, need as simple as possible user interface.
For those persons, this project was created.
It is assumed that another person puts the mp3 (or other VLC-playable format) audio files under the "book" folder.
To play the book, you need to touch the screen.
To pause playing, you need to touch the screen.
This is it. The whole user interface.


## Prerequisites and Environment

You will need VLC and:

    sudo apt-get install python-dbus
